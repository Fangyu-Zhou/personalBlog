# personalBlog
This is a individual develop project learned from teacher Lrm.
I'm developing this blog web to be used as my personal blog when finishing

Currently working on the backend (Backend management part complete!)

there is something more can bt done later:
    1. choose between publish and List should allow save the content in publish page
    2. when editing or publishing blogs, tags and topics can be also be new ones and insert into database!
    3. user end shows only the published blog
    4. read in details in markdownUtils!!! Learn how to utilize dependencies!!
    5. blogDetails url need to be redifined after deploying
    6. add user to comment (allow user to register)
    7. add comments manage for the admin(back end)
    
Development is moved to Heroku Git
