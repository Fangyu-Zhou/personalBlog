# personalBlog
This is a individual develop project learned from teacher Lrm.
I'm developing this blog web to be used as my personal blog when finishing

Currently working on the backend (Backend management part complete!)

there is something more can bt done later:
    1. choose between publish and List should allow save the content in publish page
    2. when editing or publishing blogs, tags and topics can be also be new ones and insert into database!
